# react-native-manager
My implementation of the manager app from Stephen Grider's React Native with Redux course on Udemy

To run the app, first clone the repository.
Then navigate to the project directory and run:
```
npm install
react-native run-ios
```

You will need to provide a firebase configuration in src/config.json. [See instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup)
